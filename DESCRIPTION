Description: 
  Tatoo ("Table Tools") provides three straight-forward helper to combine multiple
  data.frames to tables that are otherwise awkward to create in base-r, and a
  way to add metadata (id, title, ...) to a table. In addition, the Tatto_report
  class is provided as a convenient helper to write several Tatoo tables to a 
  workbook, one table per worksheet.
