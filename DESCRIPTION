Description: 
  Three straight-forward functions to combine multiple data.frames to tables 
  that are otherwise awkward to create in base-r, and a
  way to add metadata (id, title, ...) to a table. In addition, the Tatoo_report
  class is provided as a convenient helper to write several Tatoo tables to a 
  workbook, one table per worksheet.
